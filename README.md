# ClassGenerator

This is s simple console program I created to help me create all the basic files for my rest api.
As I was creating the files I realized I could do it very generic for the basic CRUD operations using very basic generics and some lambda. Since I had already a lot of entities, I've decided to stop and create this, that helped me to create all the files, or at least, gave me a place to grow from.

It's very basic, easy to understand but also very specialized in what I needed. If it serves you any purpose, feel free to use; I just ask to let me know for what you used it.
